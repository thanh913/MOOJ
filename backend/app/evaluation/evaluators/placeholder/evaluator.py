Placeholder evaluator implementation.

This evaluator provides a simple implementation that:
1. Generates random errors
2. Provides success/failure evaluation
3. Processes appeals with random success rate

It serves as a demonstration of the evaluator architecture and a starting
point for more sophisticated implementations.
