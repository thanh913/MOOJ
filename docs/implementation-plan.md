## Introduction

This document outlines the sequential steps for implementing the MOOJ platform. It's organized into phases, with each phase building on the previous one. The implementation follows a progressive approach:

- **Phases**: The project is divided into 6 phases from MVP to launch
- **Steps**: Each phase contains numbered implementation steps
- **Status**: Completed steps are marked with "Done"
- **Details**: Each step includes sub-tasks that elaborate on the implementation details

When implementing features, always check the current phase and prioritize steps in the order they appear. Once a step is completed, mark it as "Done" and update the Development Progress section in [Development Guide](development/guide.md).

## Phase 3: Advanced Evaluation

> **Note**: Currently, the evaluation modules are implemented as placeholders due to their complex logic. Full implementation will occur after the webapp is completely set up with placeholder modules and UI.

      - Handles conversion of image submissions to LaTeX format
    - find_all_errors implementation
      - Currently using placeholder implementation
      - Identifies all errors in a submitted solution
    - evaluate_solution implementation
      - Currently using placeholder implementation
      - Generates score and feedback based on identified errors
    - return_evaluation function
      - Integrates the above modules into complete pipeline
      - Handles the appeals process and re-evaluation
    - Parallel processing implementation
      - Worker queue for distributing evaluation tasks
