1. Read Context Documentation First: Begin by reading llm-readme.md to understand current development progress, completed steps, and next priorities.

2. Follow Implementation Plan and Update Documentation: Execute steps in implementation-plan.md sequentially. Mark completed steps with "Done" plus a brief summary. Update project-information.md with technical details, project-rules.md with new standards, and llm-readme.md's Development Progress section.

3. Cross-Reference Documentation: When implementing features, reference relevant sections from project-rules.md and project-information.md to ensure alignment with established standards.

4. No Inventions: Don't implement changes beyond what's explicitly requested.

5. Single Chunk Edits: Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions for the same file.

6. Documentation Completeness: Ensure implementation-plan.md, project-information.md, project-rules.md, and llm-readme.md remain synchronized as the project evolves.

7. Project Rules Maintenance: When implementation reveals the need for new standards or practices, update project-rules.md accordingly.

8. Progress Tracking: After completing implementation steps, update the Development Progress section in llm-readme.md, moving items from "In Progress" to "Completed Steps" and updating "Next Steps".
